# Group-1-Project
Group Project for the CIS-247 C++ November 2020 Session Class
=============================================================

This repo will serve as our dedicated hub for any and all files that will be used to create our group's final project for class.

This will allow us to professionally document any changes made to a particular file, as well as visually see our workflow and identify 
any issues that may need to be addressed.

<b>If we all manage to at least contribute small parts to this project, we shouldn'y have any problems designing an awesome, intuitive program that will be able to do anything we need it to!</b>
